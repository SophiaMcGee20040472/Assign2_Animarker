Animarker 2021-2022 Version

Student No: 20040472

Overview 
This project is an Android Studio Mobile Application written in Kotlin. The name of this Application is Animarker.
I decided to make an app for nature lovers that can upload pictures of animals they spot all over the world and pinpoint where they saw them so others might have a chance to go there and take in the scenery. I have included Species Name, Description, Destination and Date in which the animal is spotted. You have the option to add your animal spotted on the map and it will give you the exact lat and lng of where it was spotted it then saves when updated.You have the option to sign up and log in. I also thought this could be a good app for lost and stray animals that are spotted so that owners trying to track their pet might be able to search for animals spotted in the area.I would have liked to add a lot more to this application but I have run out of time. I would like to investigate firebase in the future.

Put Logo on App Icon
In designing this I went through many different colour options and settled on a primary option and a secondary option 
with a contrasting colour scheme. I tried to keep consistency of colour font and font sizes throughout the app. If I had 
more time I would make it look more aesthetically pleasing.

I have a sign up and login feature along with using jsonStore and userJson store to store information. 
The Application starts with a logo icon you can click on that then brings you to the Splash screen, then 
it continues onto the View List page this is where all animarkers are listed. You then have the option to 
add an Animarker in the top right corner.  On the next page I have added a ratings button, datepicker and set location option.
